# Red-Crab: An Open Source, Modular PID controller.
RED-CRAB is an Open Source PID Controller designed for easy and flexible prototyping with PID controllers.
Offering vast selection of control parameters, this Project could be implemented in applications from hobbyist projects to home devices to industrial equipment where closed loop systems are required.

The idea of this project is to use a modular approach where different ad-ons could be used with the Basic PID controller board for controlling applications. Add-on Boards will be designed next added to the repository.
(OSHW Community can contribute in designing add-ons).
