RED-CRAB is an Open Source PID Controller designed for easy and flexible prototyping with PID controllers.
Offering vast selection of control parameters, this Project could be implemented in applications from hobbyist projects to home devices to industrial equipment where closed loop systems are required.
The idea of this project is to use a modular approach where different ad-ons could be used with the Basic PID controller board for controlling applications. Add-on Boards will be designed next added to the repository. (OSHW Community can contribute in designing add-ons).

Features:
-Selectable P,PI,PID configurations.
-Adjustable GAINs using 50kOHM Potentiometers.
-DIP Switches for Controller Configuration
-Wide DC Voltage Input Range 
- 4-Layer Board with special Care to EMC/EMI for use in commercial applications.
- Open Source under GPL 3.0. (See License)
-Integrated Output Current Aplification for Larger Loads
-Ability to power External Peripherals
